# JuliaXRTS: X-Ray Thomson Scattering and Photon Transport in Julia

JuliaXRTS is a collection of Julia packages for modeling, simulating, and analyzing X-ray Thomson Scattering (XRTS) and related photon–matter interactions.
Our goal is to provide high-performance, extensible, and modularized tools for both theory and experiment, from warm dense matter research to photon transport in complex environments.

⚠️ The packages in this organization are currently under construction. Be aware, changes might be pushed without notification and will break APIs violently.
